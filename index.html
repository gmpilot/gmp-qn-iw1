    What is cloud computing? Describe three basic components of cloud computing.
	</summary> <pre>
	
  Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted 
services over the internet. These services are divided into three main 
categories: infrastructure as a service ( IaaS ), platform as a service ( PaaS) and 
software as a service ( SaaS ). A cloud can be private or public. cloud computing
uses the Internet and the web to shift many of these computer activities from 
the user’s computer to other computers on the Internet.
The basic components of cloud computing in a simple topology are divided into 
3 (three) parts, namely clients, datacenter, and distributed servers. The three 
basic components have specific goals and roles in running cloud computing 
operations. 

The concept of the three components can be described as follows:

• Clients on cloud computing architecture are said to be the exact same 
things that are plain, old, everyday local area networks (LANs). They are, 
typically, the computers that just sit on your desk. But they might also be 
laptops, tablet computers, mobile phones, or PDAs - all big drivers for 
cloud computing because of their mobility. Clients are interacting with to 
manage their information on the cloud.

• Datacenter is collection of servers where the application to which you 
subscribe is housed. It could be a large room in the basement of your 
building full of servers on the other side of the world that you access via 
the Internet. A growing trend in the IT world is virtualizing servers. That 
is, software can be installed allowing multiple instances of virtual servers 
to be used. In this way, you can have half a dozen virtual servers running 
on one physical server.

• Distributed Servers is a server placement in a different location. But the 
servers don't have to be housed in the same location. Often, servers are 
in geographically disparate locations. But to you, the cloud subscribers, 
these servers act as if they're humming away right next to each other.

    What are desktop operating systems? 
	</summary><pre>
  Desktop operating system is the control program in a user's machine (desktop 
or laptop). Also called a "client operating system," Windows is the 
overwhelming majority while the Macintosh comes second. There are also 
several versions of Linux for the desktop. Desktop operating system is an 
operating system that is intended for a desktop computer. These operating 
system usually come with things that one would probably use at a desk. For
example, Windows sometimes comes with Microsoft Office pre-installed. 

Example : 
• Mac OS
• Windows OS
• Linux OS

    Define computer memory including RAM, ROM and flash memory. 
	</summary><pre>
  Memory is the faculty which stores and remembers information. A computer 
memory also stores and remembers information.
There are some types of memory : RAM , ROM , FLASH memory etc……

RAM : Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, 
which it uses to handle all active tasks and apps. None of our programs, files, 
games, or streams would work without RAM. 

ROM : ROM, which stands for read only memory, is a memory device or storage 
medium that stores information permanently. It is also the primary memory unit 
of a computer along with the random access memory (RAM). It is called read 
only memory as we can only read the programs and data stored on it but cannot 
write on it. It is restricted to reading words that are permanently stored within 
the unit.

FLASH : Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile computer memory storage 
medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The two main types 
of flash memory, NOR flash and NAND flash, are named for 
the NOR and NAND logic gates. NOR and NAND flash use the same cell design, 
consisting of floating gate MOSFETs

   Discuss ways to protect computer security.
	</summary> <pre>
 Computers are created to increase productivity – personal or business use. 
Automation is possible through the use of computers and the internet which 
make everyday operations and transactions more efficient and more accurate. 
However, there are threats to the health of computers. Virus, malware, and other 
forms of threats are anywhere in the digital environment. Based on the 2016 
statistics, about 40% of computers in US households are affected by viruses. In 
the world, over 30% of computers are under threat. Just recently, at least 150 
countries are affected by a cyber attack in a form of “ransomware”. More than 
treatment and troubleshooting, it is best to be cautious at all time. Every user 
should prevent various types of computer threats and risks from attacking their 
computers. 
Follow these some effective tips to keep our computer safe and secure:

Install Anti-Virus Software :
It is a standard that we install an anti-virus software on our computer. There are 
many free anti-virus software available on the internet. Apart from the virus, 
there are other software that specifically target other threats including malware, 
spyware, and Trojans, among others that slow down the performance of our 
computer.

Update Our OS & Software : 
Keep our computer up to date. Check from time to time if there are updates on 
the operating system and software available. The updates will help fix certain 
irregularities in our system that may increase the risk of threats entering our 
computer.

Check Our Firewall : 
The firewall acts as a barrier between the computer and any unauthorized 
programs trying to access the system through the internet. Most computer 
systems, especially Windows have built-in firewall hardware. Check if it is 
turned on. We can also install firewall software for more security.

Back Up Our Data : 
Make sure that we back up all our data to an external storage. Backing up can 
be done online or through an external storage device. We can send all our data 
to online cloud storage like Dropbox and Google Drive. This is important in case 
our computer crashes due to power outage or cyber attack.

Always Scan :
We cannot prevent other devices from connecting to our computer – flash 
drives, external storage devices, and smartphones. Make it a habit that we 
thoroughly scan these external devices before accessing them to avoid entry 
of viruses.

Protect Our Email :
One of the favorite entries of viruses and other forms of security threats is our 
email. Make sure that we enable spam filters or we add anti-spam or virus 
extensions that regularly scans our email for some threats.

Don’t Click Mail Links : 
Some emails may still enter our inbox. When we open them, avoid clicking the 
email links especially if the email sender is unfamiliar to us. Most of these are 
fraudsters and phishers. Usually, they come in form of banks, insurance 
companies, promos, games, lottery etc.

Use Trusted Browsers :
Use browsers that are common and are known to be safe and trusted. The most 
reliable browsers available are Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. These browsers 
have built-in security features that minimize the risk of our computer from 
acquiring viruses, malware, etc. We can also check the security and privacy 
settings of the browsers where we can manage certain areas in the browser 
that strengthens the security.

Manage Our Passwords :
It is best that we choose the strongest passwords that we can think of. Don’t 
use the same passwords for different accounts. Avoid using birthdays, name 
initials, and other easy to guess passwords. Moreover, it is important that we
regularly update our passwords once a month to tighten the security.

    Describe the input and output devices needed when playing computer games, including combination input and output devices.
	</summary><pre>
  An input/output device, often known as an IO device, is any hardware that 
allows a human operator or other systems to interface with a computer. 
Input/output devices, as the name implies, are capable of delivering data 
(output) to and receiving data from a computer (input). An input/output (I/O) 
device is a piece of hardware that can take, output, or process data. It receives 
data as input and provides it to a computer, as well as sends computer data to 
storage media as a storage output.

When we play game we need some input and output devices . 
There are : 

• Keyboard 
• Mouse
• Joystick
• Monitor

Keyboard : The keyboard is the most frequent and widely used input device for 
entering data into a computer. Although there are some additional keys for 
performing other operations, the keyboard layout is similar to that of a typical 
typewriter. When We play Game we need keyboard for input some commands.

Mouse : The most common pointing device is the mouse. The mouse is used 
to move a little cursor across the screen while clicking and dragging. The cursor 
will stop if you let go of the mouse. The computer is dependent on us to move 
the mouse; it won’t move by itself. As a result, it’s an input device. A mouse is 
an input device that lets we move the mouse on a flat surface to control the 
coordinates and movement of the on-screen cursor/pointer. The left mouse 
button can be used to select or move items, while the right mouse button when 
clicked displays extra menus. When We play Game we need a Mouse for control 
our gamming movement

Joystick : A joystick is a pointing device that is used to move the cursor on a 
computer screen. A spherical ball is attached to both the bottom and top ends 
of the stick. In a socket, the lower spherical ball slides. We can move the 
joystick in all four directions. The joystick’s function is comparable to that of a 
mouse. It is primarily used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and playing video 
games on the computer. Some Gamer use Joystick. But I don’t use this.

Monitor : Monitors, also known as Visual Display Units (VDUs), are a computer’s 
primary output device. It creates images by arranging small dots, known as 
pixels, in a rectangular pattern. The amount of pixels determines the image’s 
sharpness. When we play game, we need monitor for see our output.
